# Amazon S3 Object Lambda Access Points
- Use _AWS Lambda Function_ to change the object before it is retrieved by the caller application
- Only one S3 bucket is needed, on top of which we create _S3 Access Point_ and _S3 Object Lambda Access Points_

## Use-cases
- Redacting PII for analytics or non-prod envs
- Converting data formats (XML -> JSON)
- Augmenting data with information form other services (DB)
- Compressing/decompressing files as they are being downloaded
- Resizing and watermarking images on the fly using caller-specific details
- Implementing custom auth rules to access data
